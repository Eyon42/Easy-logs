## High-Level Project Summary

NASA tracks relevant events occured on each particular mission through collaborators that record logs for a particular data source to evaluate the mission success after finished. However, missed critical events from collaborators, a tedious logging process, and little variety of recorded data are strong disadvantages of this approach. Therefore, we propose a real-time collaboration platform to increase NASA missions success over time. This system handles hundreds of concurrent records, simplifies the data management and distribution, and displays relevant records for each collaborator by using a sophisticated ML/AI suggestion algorithm as well as to bring an enjoyable UI experience.
